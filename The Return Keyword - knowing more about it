A brief knowledge on how the "return" keyword works:

Instead of printing something to the screen, 
what if you want to make it the value that the function outputs so it can be used elsewhere in your program? 
In PHP, the return keyword does just that. 
It returns to us a value that we can work with. 
The difference between this and echo or print is that it doesn't actually display the value.

Think of it like a calculator solving a mathematical problem that takes several steps to complete. 
The value from each step is computed, but we don't see the result until we get the final answer. 
In other words, each value is returned and the final answer is echoed on screen for us.
