In the below example, $deck is an array which contains 3 rows, each being a playing card. 
Within each row, it has the name of the card, along with the value.
Example:

 <?php
        $deck = array(array('2 of Diamonds', 2),
                      array('5 of Diamonds', 5),
                      array('7 of Diamonds', 7));
        
      // Imagine the first chosen card was the 7 of Diamonds.
      // This is how we would show the user what they have:
      echo 'You have the ' . $deck[2][0] . '!';
      ?>
